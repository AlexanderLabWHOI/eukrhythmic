Workflow to be defined in *all* rule in the ultimate Snakemake file: 

- fastqc is applied to assess the quality of the reads, and then we store this information 
- trimmomatic is used to trim and quality control the reads in this way 
- fastqc is then applied again to evaluate the quality of the reads subsequent to trimming.
